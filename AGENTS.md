# AGENTS.md — Resume instructions for Luminary

**Read this file first** when continuing work on this project (Cursor, Claude, or any AI coding assistant).

## Project

**Luminary: Echoes of the Forgotten Age** — offline Electron desktop monster-taming RPG (Pokémon-like, deeper story/combat). Local folder may be named `Pokemon`; the npm package is `luminary-game`.

## Current checkpoint — v0.5 "The Warden's Oath" (PAUSED)

**Build order steps 1–7 are DONE.** Do not rebuild them unless fixing bugs.

| Step | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1. Electron + save system | ✅ | `main.js` SaveManager, 3 slots, SHA-256, rolling backups |
| 2. Title + new game flow | ✅ | Name, starter pick, slot pick (`starterId` saved) |
| 3. Basic map + movement | ✅ | Map-driven `WorldScene` |
| 4. Ashfen town + NPCs | ✅ | Warps, DialogueBox, story flags |
| 5. Encounters + battle | ✅ | Fight/Item/Switch/Capture/Run, learning, evolutions, bond |
| 6. North Road + species + rival + shop + dex | ✅ | Trainer battles, ShopPanel, DexPanel |
| 7. First dungeon + Warden | ✅ | Hollow Cave, 2 acolytes, Warden Thane, Warden's Oath, badge |
| 8. Echo Vault UI + Keldrath opener | ⏭️ **NEXT** | See "Next session" in `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` |
| 9–15 | pending | Status conditions, regions, story acts… |

## Exactly where we left off (2026-06-11, session 3, v0.5)

The last session ended after v0.5 was verified end-to-end
(save-smoke 6/6, `npm run engine-test` 120/120, live playtest 59/59). Resume by:

1. `npm run save-smoke` and `npm run engine-test` — all must PASS
2. Optional live verification: `npm run playtest-game` in one terminal, `npm run playtest` in another — 59 checks (uses and then deletes save slot_3)
3. Start on the **Echo Vault UI**: deposit/withdraw at Save Shrines between `party` (≤6) and `vault` (≤300). Reuse the PartyPanel overlay pattern (`src/systems/PartyPanel.js`); hook into the shrine confirm in `WorldScene.openShrine`
4. Then the **Keldrath Coast opener**: `keldrath_gate` map east of the North Road (east end of row 9 is currently walled with a `T`), pass-warden NPC that checks `storyFlags.badge_lowlands`, first coast town, 4–6 new Tide/Wind species toward 30
5. Then status conditions (burn/sleep + Shattered/Echoed/Hollowed) and Echo Surge at Bond 10

**Playtest scripting gotchas** (see PROJECT_STATE.md "Verified tests"): wrap
waitFor expressions in `Boolean(...)` (Phaser objects break CDP serialization);
never blind-press Z while a ShopPanel might be open (it buys); trainer fights
are losable — keep the test leads at Lv 20/25 or wins are nondeterministic.

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # first clone only
npm run fix-electron # if electron.exe missing after install
npm start            # launch game
npm run save-smoke   # headless save tests (6 checks, must all PASS)
npm run engine-test  # headless battle/data tests (120 checks, no Electron)
npm run playtest-game  # terminal 1: game with CDP port 9223
npm run playtest       # terminal 2: automated playthrough (59 checks)
node scripts/screenshot-cdp.mjs  # PNG of the running game → %TEMP%/luminary-shot.png
```

## Critical conventions

1. **Save system first** — any new gameplay state must be added to the save schema in `SaveSystem.js` (`newGame`) and validated in `main.js` (`isShapedLikeASave`). Auto-save after: battle end, item pickup, map transition, dialogue completion, capture. (All of these are wired except item pickup — no items exist in the world yet.)
2. **No internet at runtime** — no external APIs.
3. **Stack:** Electron + Phaser 3 (not 4) + electron-store + classic script tags (no bundler). New files must be added to `src/index.html` in dependency order.
4. **Windows productName:** must NOT contain `:` — crashes Electron userData path.
5. **IPC:** renderer uses `window.LuminaryNative` from `preload.cjs` only — never enable `nodeIntegration`.
6. **UI:** dark fantasy — navy/slate bg, gold accents. Keyboard: arrows/WASD, Z/Enter confirm, X/Esc cancel.
7. **Scene handoff:** WorldScene ↔ BattleScene via `scene.start` both ways; world position/map always live in `Save.state`, so rebuilding WorldScene is safe.
8. **Settings:** read synchronously from `window.GameSettings` (cached in `game.js`, kept fresh by SettingsScene).
9. **Do not commit** `node_modules/`, `.electron-cache/`, or player save files.

## Story / design reference

Full creative spec (180+ Luminary, 8 regions, 8 chapters, battle rules) is in `docs/DESIGN_SPEC.md`. Starters: **Embrik** (Flame), **Tidalink** (Tide), **Thornpaw** (Verdant). Player default name: Kael. Rival **Lyra** is placed in Ashfen Town and her intro dialogue sets `storyFlags.met_lyra`.
