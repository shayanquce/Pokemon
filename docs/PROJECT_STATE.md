# Project State — v0.7 "The Coast Road" checkpoint (2026-06-11)

> Paused after build-order step 8: Echo Vault UI + the Keldrath Coast opener.
> All automated tests pass: 6 save-smoke, 162 engine checks, 74 live CDP
> playtest checks, plus visual verification via screenshot/texture dumps.

## What runs today

### v0.7 content (step 8)

- **Echo Vault UI** (`src/systems/VaultPanel.js`): Save Shrines now open a
  3-option menu (Rest & Record / Echo Vault / Leave — `WorldScene.openShrine`).
  The vault is a two-column overlay: party (≤6) left, vault (≤300, 9-per-page,
  Up/Down past the edge flips pages) right. Left/Right switch columns, Z
  transfers, X closes (auto-saves `vault`). Rules: party keeps ≥1 Luminary AND
  ≥1 conscious one; vault caps at 300
- **Keldrath Gate** (`keldrath_gate`): east of the North Road (row 9 east end
  opened). New walkable tile `s` sand (`tile_sand`). Gate wall splits grass
  west from shore east; **Pass-Warden Hale** stands in the gap at (19,9)
- **Gate NPC mechanic** (data-driven, reusable): `gate: { requiresFlag,
  grantsFlag, asideX/Y, deniedDialogue, grantedDialogue }` on an NPC def.
  Without `badge_lowlands` he refuses; with it he grants
  `coast_pass_granted` and **steps aside** (tween via `WorldScene.stepAside`;
  collision follows `npc.x/y`, which now shadows `def.x/y` — `npcAt` uses
  npc.x/y, and granted gate NPCs spawn at their aside spot on re-entry)
- **Keldrath Coast — Harborside** (`keldrath_town`): first coast town. NPCs:
  Dockmaster Orla (sets `heard_chain_rumor` — Hollowed Chain hook), sailor
  Pim (Lyra went north along the cliffs), kid Nina (Saltshell flavor). Two
  flavor doors. No encounters in town
- **5 new species (23 total, dex 22–26)**: Brinepup (Tide/Beast), Gullwisp
  (Wind/Spirit), Saltshell (Tide/Stone), Driftbloom (Verdant/Wind), Sparkfin
  (Volt/Tide) — all with pixel maps, in the gate-map encounter table (Lv 8–12)

### v0.6 presentation overhaul

Everything from v0.5 (4 maps, 18 species, trainers, rival, Warden's Oath,
badge, shop, dex), plus:

- **Hi-res character sprites**: player + every NPC rebuilt as 16x24 pixel
  maps (was 8x14) with auto-derived shading from the same 6-key palettes the
  map NPC defs already used (`charPalette` derives hair/skin/cloak shades),
  generated dark outline, and **3-frame walk cycles** for all 4 facings
  (`player_down_0..2`, `npc_<id>_side_1`, …). Side frames face right, flipX
  gives left. See `CHAR_BODY` / `CHAR_LEGS` in `PlaceholderArt.js`
- **Luminary sprite upgrade**: every species map is EPX/Scale2x-doubled
  TWICE (16x the pixels, staircase corners rounded), run through a volume
  shading pass (`shadeGrid`: lit top rims, dark undersides, vertical
  gradient) and outlined. Canvas is now ~66x50, so **all `lum_` call sites
  display at half their old scale** (battle 2/2.5, party 0.8, summary 1.5,
  dex 0.4, starter cards 2/2.25). Keep that rule for new UI
- **Movement feel**: tap-to-turn (a short press turns in place, holding
  walks), 140ms steps that chain with zero stutter (held key re-checked in
  the tween's onComplete), stride frames swap mid-step, drop shadows under
  characters, footstep dust tinted by ground tile
- **Living world**: per-map ambient particles (grove fireflies, town leaves,
  road seed fluff, cave motes), water tiles ripple between two glint frames,
  non-trainer NPCs idly glance around, NPCs hop and turn to face you when
  addressed, crisper tree tile (stepped-circle canopy)
- **Battle life**: both sides slide onto platforms, idle breathing tweens
  (scaleY so they never fight faint/shake tweens), attacker lunges on every
  move, varied flavor text via `pick()` (intro/miss/crit/effectiveness) —
  **message COUNT per turn is unchanged** (the CDP playtest drains a fixed
  number of messages; vary text, never add messages)
- **DialogueBox** pops in (fade + 6px rise; the page arrow is excluded — it
  has its own bob tween)

## Verified tests (all passing at this commit)

```
npm run save-smoke     # 6 checks
npm run engine-test    # 162 checks — maps/species/exits are auto-derived, so
                       # new content is covered by adding data alone
npm run playtest-game  # terminal 1: game with CDP port 9223
npm run playtest       # terminal 2: 74 live checks — v0.5 set plus Echo Vault
                       # (deposit/withdraw/last-companion rule), Keldrath gate
                       # (block, grant, step-aside), coast town flags, coast
                       # wild battle + flee (uses + deletes slot_3)
node scripts/screenshot-cdp.mjs   # PNG of the running game
node scripts/cdp-eval.mjs "expr"  # eval JS in the running game, print JSON
node scripts/cdp-press.mjs ArrowDown 700  # hold a REAL key (drives isDown —
                                  # the only way to test held movement)
node scripts/dump-texture.mjs lum_embrik 6  # save a generated texture as PNG
                                  # (visual sprite check without squinting)
```

v0.6 movement was verified with cdp-press: holding Down 700ms turned the
spawned player and chained 4 steps (y 11 -> 15); a 250ms Left tap turned +
stepped once with `player_side_0` applied.

Playtest scripting gotchas (don't regress):
- Wrap waitFor expressions in `Boolean(...)` — Phaser objects break CDP
  `returnByValue`
- Only act on the 5-item battle command menu; cancel submenus first
- Never blind-press Z while a ShopPanel may be open (it buys)
- Trainer fights are genuinely losable — test leads are set to Lv 20 (rival)
  and Lv 25 (Warden) to make wins deterministic; lower levels black out via
  counter-picks and the Oath heal (that was a real test failure, not a bug)

## Architecture

```
Renderer (Phaser 3, sandboxed, classic scripts — load order in src/index.html)
  ├─ data/starters.js   LUMINARY_SPECIES (23), MOVES, makeLuminary
  ├─ data/maps.js       6 maps {rows, exits, doors, npcs, encounters}
  │                     (npc defs may carry gate:{requiresFlag,grantsFlag,…})
  ├─ data/items.js      ITEMS
  ├─ data/trainers.js   TRAINERS (lyra1, acolyte_vren, acolyte_sila,
  │                     warden_thane w/ wardenOath+setFlags) + buildTrainer
  ├─ systems/PlaceholderArt.js  ALL generated art: epxScale + shadeGrid +
  │                     gridTexture (outline) pipeline, CHAR_BODY/CHAR_LEGS
  │                     walk frames, charPalette shading, tiles (2 water
  │                     frames), STARTER_PIXELMAPS
  ├─ systems/BattleEngine.js  pure battle math
  ├─ systems/PartyPanel.js    PartyPanel + ItemsPanel overlays
  ├─ systems/VaultPanel.js    Echo Vault two-column overlay (shrine menu)
  ├─ systems/ShopPanel.js     ShopPanel + DexPanel overlays
  ├─ systems/DialogueBox.js   typewriter dialogue widget (pop-in)
  ├─ scenes/WorldScene.js     maps, walk cycle, ambient, NPC idle/hop,
  │                     battle/shop hooks
  ├─ scenes/BattleScene.js    wild + trainer battles, Oath, learn/evolve/bond,
  │                     breathing/lunge anims, pick() flavor text
  └─ window.LuminaryNative  ← preload.cjs → main.js
```

### Save `data` fields

v0.4 fields. Story flags in play: `chapter`, `echo_awakened`, `met_lyra`,
`ceremony_complete`, `rival1_won`, `acolyte_vren_won`, `acolyte_sila_won`,
`warden1_won`, `badge_lowlands`, `coast_pass_granted`, `heard_chain_rumor`.

## Implemented Luminary (23 of 180+)

Starter lines ×3 (2 stages), grove lines ×3 (2 stages), road wilds ×5,
Gloombat (cave), coast wilds ×5. Dex numbers 1–26 with gaps reserved for
third stages.

## Not built yet (do not assume exists)

- Status conditions; Echo Surge (Bond 10); bond from shrine rests
- Evolutions for road/cave/coast wilds; third-stage starter evolutions
- Keldrath cliff road north (Pim mentions it; map doesn't exist)
- Building interiors, audio, packaging, full 18×18 type chart
- Healer NPC (blackout/shrine are the only full heals)
- Coast shop/noticeboard (Orla mentions a noticeboard; doesn't exist)

## Next session — plan (in priority order)

1. **Status conditions** in battle (burn/sleep + spec's Shattered/Echoed/
   Hollowed), then Echo Surge at Bond 10
2. **Chapter 1 story beats**: Elder Maren post-badge dialogue, first
   Hollowed Chain scout encounter on the coast (follows `heard_chain_rumor`)
3. **Evolutions** for road/cave/coast wilds (Voltail, Bristleboar, Gloombat,
   Brinepup… — design stats + pixel maps)
4. **Keldrath cliff road** north (`keldrath_cliffs`): next route toward the
   second Warden, Lyra rematch on the way
5. Healer NPC in Ashfen Town or Keldrath (free rest)
